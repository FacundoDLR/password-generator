![Design preview for the Password generator app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi stranger, sorry but IÂ´m still working on the solution for this front-end coding challenge. In a few days a will publish it.

## The challenge

This challenge is to build out this password generator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
